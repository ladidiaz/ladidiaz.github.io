            In 1992 Bogota, a little girl (<b>Amandla Stenberg</b>) watches 
            crime lord Don Luis (<b>Beto Benites</b>) and his henchman Marco
            (<b>Jordi Moll√†</b>) murder her parents. Fifteen years later, the 
            now-grown Cataleya (<b>Zoe Saldana</b>), who is named for a 
            Colombian orchid, works as a contract killer for her Chicago-based 
            uncle (<b>Cliff Curtis</b>). Leaving a lipstick drawing of her 
            namesake on every victim, Cataleya carries out her assignments with
            cold, frightening efficiency and dreams of avenging her family.

            The story of a man (<b>Matt Damon</b>), salvaged, near death, from 
            the ocean by an Italian fishing boat. When he recuperates, the man
            suffers from total amnesia, without identity or background... 
            except for a range of extraordinary talents in fighting, 
            linguistic skills and self-defense that speak of a dangerous past.
            He sets out on a desperate search-assisted by the initially 
            rebellious Marie (<b>Franka Potente</b>) - to discover who he really
            is, and why he's being lethally pursued by assassins.

            When Evelyn Salt (<b>Angelina Jolie</b>) became a CIA officer, she 
            swore an oath to duty, honor and country. But, when a defector 
            accuses her of being a Russian spy, Salt's oath is put to the test.
            Now a fugitive, Salt must use every skill gained from years of 
            training and experience to evade capture, but the more she tries 
            to prove her innocence, the more guilty she seems.

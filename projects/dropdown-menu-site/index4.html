                        Hello. My name is John Wish.
                        If you are wondering how I got that name that would come 
                        from an old pal. I was born alone so I had no name  
                        and some would say I was lucky because I survived. So he
                        just gave me the name John Wish. John as in no name and 
                        Wish as to lucky I guess. If I had to consider my
                        name, I wish I had a home...  
                    </p>

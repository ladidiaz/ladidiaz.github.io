                    Palette and Plate Gallery was founded in 1974<br>
                    by two young best friends, Jocena Grace and<br> Will Green. Jocena was an up
                    and coming artist<br> in the LA area who had a minimalist 
                    approach in<br> her art and with that approach it was hard to 
                    get<br> her work in galleries. Will, her best friend was a<br> chef
                    and always wanted to be the head chef at<br> his own 
                    restaurant and so he brought the idea<br> of him and Jocena
                    partnering to open a restaurant<br> where he could live his 
                    dream as head chef and<br> she could display her art in the
                    restaurant. From<br> that day on they decided that they 
                    would only go<br> where they are valued and feel important 
                    and they<br> also wanted to create that same environment 
                    for<br> their customers. That mindset is how they brought<br> 
                    fine dining and art together at Palette and 
                    Plate Gallery.

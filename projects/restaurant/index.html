                    Palette and Plate Gallery was founded in 1974 by
                    two young best friends, Jocena Grace and Will
                    Green. Jocena was an up and coming artist
                    in the LA area who had a minimalist approach in
                    her art and with that approach it was hard to get
                    her work in galleries. Will, her best friend was a
                    chef and always wanted to be the head chef at
                    his own restaurant and so he brought the idea
                    of him and Jocena partnering to open a restaurant
                    where he could live his dream as head chef and
                    she could display her art in the restaurant. From
                    that day on they decided that they would only go 
                    where they are valued and feel important and they
                    also wanted to create that same environment for
                    their customers. That mindset is how they brought 
                    fine dining and art together at<br>
                    Palette and Plate Gallery.

                    Bernard Jeffrey McCullough (October 5, 1957 – August 9, 
                    2008),[1] better known by his stage name Bernie Mac, was an
                    American comedian and actor. Born and raised on Chicago's 
                    South Side, Mac gained popularity as a stand-up comedian. 
                    He joined fellow comedians Steve Harvey, Cedric the 
                    Entertainer, and D. L. Hughley in the film The Original 
                    Kings of Comedy.
                <p>    
                    After briefly hosting the HBO show Midnight Mac, Mac 
                    appeared in several films in smaller roles. His most noted 
                    film roles were as Frank Catton in the Ocean's film series 
                    from 2001 through 2007 and as the title character of Mr. 
                    3000. He was the star of his eponymous show, which ran from
                    2001 through 2006, earning him two Emmy Award nominations 
                    for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series.

                    Bernard Jeffrey McCullough was born on October 5, 1957, in 
                    Chicago, Illinois.[2] Mac was the second child of Mary 
                    McCullough and Jeffrey Harrison.[3] Mac was raised by his 
                    single mother and his grandparents on the city's south 
                    side.[4]
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mac began his high school career at Chicago Vocational High 
                    School. During 1973, Mac moved to Tampa, Florida, to attend
                    Jesuit High School following the death of his mother during
                    his sophomore year.[5] Shortly afterward, Mac's older 
                    brother and his estranged father both died. Mac later 
                    returned to Chicago and graduated from Chicago Vocational 
                    in 1975.[6]

                <P>
                    During his 20s and through his early 30s, Mac worked in a 
                    variety of jobs, including janitor, coach, professional 
                    mover, cook, bus driver, Wonder Bread delivery man, 
                    furniture mover, and UPS agent, while doing comedy on the 
                    weekends at clubs and parties.[5]

                <p>
                    Mac's influences were from The Three Stooges and listening 
                    to stand-up comedians Richard Pryor and Redd Foxx. Mac 
                    started as a stand-up comedian in Chicago's Cotton Club. 
                    After he won the Miller Lite Comedy Search at the age of 32,
                    his popularity as a comedian began to grow. In 1992, a 
                    performance on the 3rd episode of HBO's Def Comedy Jam 
                    thrust him into the spotlight; after Martin Lawrence was 
                    unable to calm an increasingly hostile crowd, Mac went 
                    onstage and told the audience "I ain't scared o' you
                    m...." and that he "didn't come here for no 
                    foolishness."[7]

                <p>
                    In 2001, the Fox network gave Mac his own television sitcom
                    called The Bernie Mac Show portraying a fictional version
                    of himself. In the show, he suddenly becomes custodian of
                    his sister's three children after she enters rehab. Mac
                    broke the fourth wall to tell his thoughts to the
                    audience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The show contained many parodies of events in Bernie's 
                    actual life. Mac, who grew up on Chicago's South Side, was
                    a fan of the Chicago White Sox, and would often sneak a 
                    reference to his favorite team in episodes, including 
                    enlisting then-White Sox pitcher Jon Garland to make a 
                    guest cameo appearance. In the 2005 season he wore a White 
                    Sox jacket and cap, and congratulated his hometown Chicago
                    White Sox and their staff members on their recent World 
                    Series championship.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The show was not renewed after the 2005–2006 season. The 
                    series finale aired on April 14, 2006. Among other awards, 
                    the show won an Emmy[8] for "Outstanding Writing", the 
                    Peabody Award for excellence in broadcasting, and the 
                    Humanitas Prize for television writing that promotes human 
                    dignity.[9] His character on The Bernie Mac Show was 
                    ranked No. 47 in TV Guide's list of the "50 Greatest TV 
                    Dads of All Time".[10]

                <p>
                    During his run on the show, Mac had co-starring roles in 
                    the Ocean's trilogy (2001–2007), Head of State (2003) and 
                    Bad Santa (2003), as well as starring roles in the 
                    baseball-themed film Mr. 3000 (2004) and Guess Who? (2005), 
                    a remake of the 1967 film Guess Who's Coming to Dinner.

                <h4>Later Years</h4>
                <p>
                    On March 19, 2007, Mac told David Letterman on the CBS Late 
                    Show that he would retire from his 30-year career after he 
                    finished shooting the comedy film, The Whole Truth, Nothing 
                    but the Truth, So Help Me Mac. "I'm going to still do my 
                    producing, my films, but I want to enjoy my life a little 
                    bit", Mac told Letterman. "I missed a lot of things, you 
                    know. I was a street performer for two years. I went into 
                    clubs in 1977 and was on the road 47 weeks out of 
                    the year."[11]
                </p>
                <p>
                    During this time, Mac was having success as a popular film 
                    actor, starting with an appearance in the 2007 film 
                    Transformers as the car salesman "Bobby Bolivia", and 
                    serving as the voice of Zuba, Alex the Lion's long-lost 
                    father in Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa. He co-starred with 
                    Samuel L. Jackson in the 2008 musical comedy Soul Men. 
                    These last two movies were released months after his death. 
                    His final film role was as Jimmy Lunchbox in the 2009 film 
                    Old Dogs which was released a year after his death.

                <h4>Marriage</h4>

                <p>
                    Mac married his high school sweetheart Rhonda Gore on 
                    September 17, 1977, and together they had a daughter in 
                    1978.[12][13]

                <p>
                    In the final 20 years of his life, Mac publicly disclosed 
                    that he had severe sarcoidosis, a disease of unknown origin 
                    that causes inflammation in tissue.[14] On July 19, 2008,
                    Mac was admitted to the Northwestern Memorial Hospital in
                    his hometown of Chicago.[15] After being treated in the 
                    ICU for three weeks, Mac went into cardiac arrest and 
                    subsequently died during the early morning hours on 
                    August 9, at the age of 50. However, the complications 
                    were not attributed to his sarcoidosis, according to 
                    his publicist.[16]

                <p>
                    Mac's public memorial was held a week after his death at 
                    the House of Hope Church, with nearly 7,000 people in
                    attendance.[17] Notable mourners at Mac's funeral were 
                    Chris Rock, Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley, 
                    Samuel L. Jackson, Ashton Kutcher, Don Cheadle, the cast 
                    members from The Bernie Mac Show, and his Kings of Comedy 
                    fellows D. L. Hughley, Cedric the Entertainer, and 
                    Steve Harvey.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first two of Mac's posthumous films, Soul Men and 
                    Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa, were released three months 
                    after his death and were dedicated to him. Mac's third 
                    posthumously released and final film, Old Dogs, was released
                    a year after his death. The 2008 Bud Billiken Parade, 
                    which was held in Chicago on the day of Mac's death, was 
                    also dedicated to his memory.[14] On the day of Mac's 
                    funeral, his hometown's local television station WCIU-TV 
                    aired an exclusive television special, A Tribute to 
                    Bernie Mac, and had interviews with his former colleagues 
                    including Camille Winbush, Chris Rock, Joe Torry, Cameron 
                    Diaz, Don Cheadle, and some of his family members & 
                    close friends.

                    During Steve Harvey's television show which aired
                    November 14, 2016, Harvey read a proclamation from 
                    Chicago's Mayor Rahm Emanuel proclaiming November 14 as 
                    "Bernie Mac Day".[18] Steve Harvey's guests included 
                    Bernie's wife Rhonda, their daughter Je'Niece, granddaughter
                    Jasmine, and Bernie's The Original Kings of Comedy 
                    co-stars D. L. Hughley, Cedric the Entertainer, and Guy

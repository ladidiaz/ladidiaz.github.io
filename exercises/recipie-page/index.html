            Creme Brulee Stuffed French Toast, also known as Marry Me French 
            Toast! It's so good that if you make it for someone, they might just
             ask you to marry them. The crackly sugar on top and the creamy 
            vanilla bean custard in the center take ordinary French toast to 
            not just the next level, but 100 levels up.

        <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Start out by making the custard. To a mixing bowl, whisk 
                    together cornstarch, sugar, and salt. Then add all the yolks
                     and beat until it gets lighter in color. Set aside.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    To a pot over medium heat, add the milk and vanilla extract
                     or vanilla bean. Combine together and heat it just until it
                      starts to bubble on the edges. You do not want to boil it
                       or it will be too hot.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Take off the heat and slowly add a little in at a time to
                     the batter. This is so you don't shock the egg yolks and 
                     cook them. Keep on slowly integrating the warm milk until
                      it's all whisked in and very smooth.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Then transfer back to the pot and heat over medium-low heat.
                     Continuously whisk together for a few minutes until it 
                     starts to thicken up. Immediately take off the heat and 
                     add the butter. Mix together until the butter is melted in 
                     and incorporated. Transfer the custard to a bowl.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Cover and pop in the fridge to chill.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    To a bowl, make the custard for dipping the bread in. 
                    Combine half and half, eggs, brown sugar, vanilla extract,
                     and cinnamon. Whisk really well until completely smooth 
                     and homogenous.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Heat a large pan over medium heat. Add a little bit of 
                    butter. If the pan is too hot, the butter will burn so make
                     sure it's not too high.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Add custard on top of one slice of Brioche bread. Add 
                    another slice of bread on top to seal it.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Carefully dip the stuffed bread in the French toast batter,
                     let any excess drip off, and place on the pan.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Cook for about 2 to 3 minutes or until golden and toasted 
                    and flip over to repeat on the other side. Take off the pan
                     and repeat with the rest.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Add a light sprinkle of granulated sugar on top of the 
                    French toast, just enough to cover the surface. Use a blow
                     torch to brulee the sugar until golden. Let it rest for a 
                     few minutes until the sugar hardens.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Sprinkle with powdered sugar, drizzle with maple syrup on 
                    top, or add fresh berries on top to keep it less sweet to enjoy!
                </li>

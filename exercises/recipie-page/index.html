            Creme Brulee Stuffed French Toast, also known as Marry Me French 
            Toast! It's so good that if you make it for someone, they might just
             ask you to marry them. The crackly sugar on top and the creamy 
            vanilla bean custard in the center take ordinary French toast to 
            not just the next level, but 100 levels up.
